Technologies Used:
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Go (Golang) ‚Äì Primary language for the authentication microservice; chosen for its high concurrency via goroutines and low memory overhead.

Python ‚Äì Powers core microservices such as the order engine, matching logic, and backend utilities.

Flask ‚Äì Lightweight framework used for backend APIs and newer microservices.

Django ‚Äì Initially used for API development and dynamic web rendering; now partially replaced by Flask and Go services.

Vue.js ‚Äì Modern JavaScript framework used to build the frontend UI, enabling reactive components and real-time updates.

HTML & CSS ‚Äì Core frontend technologies for layout and styling.

SQL ‚Äì PostgreSQL used for structured, transactional data storage.

NoSQL ‚Äì

MongoDB: Stores stock transactions and user portfolios.

Redis: Used for fast-access caching and storing wallet balances in real-time trading.
<hr>
üîß Supporting Technologies
Docker ‚Äì Containerizes each microservice for isolated, reproducible deployments.

Nginx ‚Äì Acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer for routing API traffic efficiently.

JWT (JSON Web Token) ‚Äì Provides stateless, secure authentication across services.

JSON ‚Äì Standard format for inter-service API communication.

RESTful API Endpoints ‚Äì Define clear boundaries between services and clients.

Postman ‚Äì Used for API validation and testing across endpoints.

JMeter ‚Äì Load testing tool used to validate performance under high concurrency.

Flask-CORS ‚Äì Manages secure cross-origin requests between frontend and backend.

Dotenv ‚Äì Manages environment variables for secure and flexible configurations.
<hr>
üöÄ Architecture & Scalability Features
Microservices Architecture ‚Äì Fully modular system enabling independent deployment and scaling of services.

Real-time Trading APIs ‚Äì Implemented using REST and optimized for low-latency order execution.

Performance Optimizations:

Caching with Redis for rapid wallet access.

Database Sharding & Replication in MongoDB for horizontal scaling and redundancy.

Load Balancing with Nginx to distribute traffic across service instances.

Concurrency Support ‚Äì System is tested and proven to handle 15,000+ concurrent users under real-world conditions.
